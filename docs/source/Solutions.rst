Solutions to Common Problems
============================

While the software itself is COMPLETELY flawless, the user may run into issues that are their OWN fault and do not reflect at all on any (nonexistent) mistakes made by the designers of this package. Here are some solutions to these problems:

**HTTP500 error
                          Note that an HTP500 error will be produced if astroquery does not recognize the given input name. 
                          If this occurs, it is reccommended to download the desired JWST fits files from https://mast.stsci.edu/portal/Mashup/Clients/Mast/Portal.html
                          and set query to False.
